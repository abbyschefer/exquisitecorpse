    <h1>What's at the end of the Rainbow?</h1>

        <!-- Isabella's section -->
        Rainbows are known as a sign of good luck, or an omen of better things
        to come, universally understood around the world. But what should happen
        if you came across one, tangible in front of you, that you could reach
        out and touch? There's no leprechaun at the start, no pot of gold to
        entice you to move forward. Taking one tentative step onto its
        multicolored surface, you're surprised to feel that it supports your
        weight, and are compelled to keep walking forward. The ground is far
        below your feet, but you're determined to see what may lie at the end of
        the rainbow.

        You have found yourself at the foot of this rainbow. You gaze up in
        disbelief, unsure of whether or not you should attempt to cross it. This
        must be the sign of good luck you have been waiting for all your life.
        You reach out and touches the rainbow, convincing yourself that it is
        real. You begin to climb to the top of it's arch, taking careful steps
        as you are unsure of how long the rainbow will last. You stand at the
        top and gaze in awe at the Earth beneath you. Suddenly, everything turns
        black.

        As the black atmosphere begins to engulf all parts of the rainbow, you
        begin to reach for any signs of luck that the rainbow once represented.
        Your steps become smaller and smaller and suddenly you can no longer
        hear the sounds of the earth that were once so loud. In this momemnt,
        you begin to feel hopeless as there is no way you will be able to find
        the beginning of the rainbow once again. Fear begins to creep in, but
        instead of letting the fear engulf you like the black surroundings did
        the rainbow, you choose to sit as still as possible. And for the first
        time the darkness is no longer scary and the silence isn't deafening.
        You accept what must be your fate but then suddenly you smell something
        familiar...

        The scent is familiar, but nothing you have ever smelled before. It
        reminds you of the world when there was light, but the darkness still
        surrounds you. You squeeze your eyes closed to envision the scent and
        your mind becomes filled with color. You realize the smell is red,
        yellow, green, and blue. You envision a pink tulip and can smell the
        color pink. You focus harder and realize this color also has a song. It
        sounds as you would imagine to be sung by a beautiful fairy. You open
        your eyes to return to the darkness, but the darkness is gone. Your seat
        has relocated to a place of tranquility. You are calm and surrounded by
        color. The end of the rainbow was no pot of gold or leperchaun, it was
        instead you finding your inner peace.
