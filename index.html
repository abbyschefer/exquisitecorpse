  <h1>Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate.</h1>

    Rainbows are known as a sign of good luck, or an omen of better things to come, universally
    understood around the world. But what should happen if you came across one, tangible in front
    of you, that you could reach out and touch? There's no leprechaun at the start, no pot of
    gold to entice you to move forward. Taking one tentative step onto its multicolored surface,
    you're surprised to feel that it supports your weight, and are compelled to keep walking forward.
    The ground is far below your feet, but you're determined to see what may lie at the end of the rainbow.

       You have found yourself at the foot of this rainbow. You gaze up in disbelief, unsure  of whether or not you should attempt to cross it. This must be the sign of good luck you have been waiting for all your life. You reach out and touches the rainbow, convincing yourself that it is real. You begin to climb to the top of it's arch, taking careful steps as you are unsure of how long the rainbow will last. You stand at the top and gaze in awe at the Earth beneath you. Suddenly, everything turns black.
